The Sound Mixer application will help musicians and music enthusiasts design their own instrument from a group of sound clips selected and edited by the user for live playing.
 
This will be achieved by first having the user import a variety of sound and music files. These files will be the first step in the process for creating custom sound bits to use in the finished product.During the import process, the application will require the user to identify the music or sound file they would like to import. The application will then ensure the file meets all the requirements including file type and size, and then store the file in a default location within the application.
 
After the desired sound files have been imported, the application will allow the user to edit individual files by specifying start and end times. This action called cropping will provide the user with a simple method of customizing their imported sounds for playback.
During the cropping process, the application will:

  Prompt the user to select a desired file to crop
  
  Play the unedited file
  
  Prompt the user for new start and end times of the file
  
  Play the edited file within the new limits
  
  Repeat until the desired sound clip is created
  
Once the cropping process is completed and the user approves the crop, the application will save the edited file in a default edited file library. When the cropping of audio files has been completed, the application will allow the user to assign the playback of their edited files to a variety of different events, including:

  Upon keyboard key press
  
  Upon mouse click
  
  Upon an external device event
  
In the assign playback setting of the application, the user will have the ability to assign the playback of their edited files to the press of a specific key on the keyboard, the click of a mouse, and/or an event performed by external hardware such as external instruments or other software.

Once all previous steps have been completed, the user may enter a playback mode in which the application will scan for events that the user has assigned. Once the correct event has occurred, the application will play the assigned music file. If a new event is triggered while a previous file is still playing, the application will continue playing the old file while beginning the new one. This will allow the user to play multiple files simultaneously. This mode will allow the user to play their edited sounds within a live setting.

With these functions, the Sound Mixer application will assist in the creation of new music for its users as well as allow its users to play their customized sounds on the fly.
